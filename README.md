This document contains original in-house R scripts used to generate the results described in the manuscript. The document is divided into the following sections. For data generated using third-party and softwares, please refer to original manuscript for methods. This page contains scripts required for

1) Alpha estimation using Breakaway
2) Plotting of DeSeq2 data
3) Sloan Modelling analysis and data plotting
4) Cross-Domain network analysis and plotting using SPIEC-EASI
5) Plotting for MetaPhlAn and HUMAnN outputs for shotgun metagenomics pilot data.

Please note that while in-house scripts required for results and figure generation are presented on this document, some minor tasks (such as table reformatting) were performed in Microsoft Excel as described throughout. Also note that the exact same scripts will not function across different computers. It is the responsibility of the readers to understand the scripts included here and modify accordingly.
